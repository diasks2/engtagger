description: A Ruby port of Perl Lingua::EN::Tagger, a probability based, corpus-trained  tagger
  that assigns POS tags to English text based on a lookup dictionary and  a set of
  probability values. The tagger assigns appropriate tags based on  conditional probabilities--it
  examines the preceding tag to determine the  appropriate tag for the current word.
  Unknown words are classified according to  word morphology or can be set to be treated
  as nouns or other parts of speech.   The tagger also extracts as many nouns and
  noun phrases as it can, using a set  of regular expressions.
